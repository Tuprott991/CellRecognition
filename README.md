# CellRecognition

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for cell segmentation using the LIVECell dataset. It includes training, evaluation, and inference scripts, as well as a custom model architecture based on DeepLabV3+.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset**: A PyTorch dataset class for the LIVECell dataset.
- **DeepLabV3+ Model**: A segmentation model with a ConvNeXt backbone and ASPP module.
- **Training Pipeline**: Includes training and evaluation loops with support for saving the best model.
- **Inference**: (Planned) Gradio-based interface for easy visualization and testing.
